		<h4 class = "white">Overview</h4>
		<p class = "white">Big Mia is played with a group of people (ideally 4-6 people) who take turns rolling a pair 
			of dice under a cup and either honestly saying or lying what  they rolled. Once a player
			has called a hand they are not allowed to touch the cup. The next player can either 
			believe the called hand and accept the cup trying to roll a larger hand or call bullshit
			on the player lifting the cup to reveal the dice. </p>

		<h4 class = "white">When do we drink?</h4>
		<p class = "white">Now we are getting to the important part. Every player has 3 lives to start, every time a play loses
			a life they drink their drink and the first person to lose all 3 lives has to take the "reward". 
			The reward can be either a shotgunned beer or a shot put up by the group. When a player loses 3 
			lives the game starts over and everyone gets 3 lives. Big Mia is about survival!</p>
	</div>
	<div class = "blockwhite">
		<h4>Gameplay</h4>
		
		<h6>Starting</h6>
		<p>The game starts with a player rolling the dice and peaking under the cup to see their hand.
			The player calls a hand and the next player clockwise can either accept the call or lift
			the cup. If the next player decides to roll, they must roll a higher or equal hand or 
			lie about rolling a higher or equal hand. This continues until some eventually calls bullshit. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "blockgrey">	
		<h6 class = "white">Losing a Life</h6>
		<p class = "white">A life is lost when player 2 calls out that  player 1 is lying:<p>
		<ol class = "white" type="1">
			<li>If player 1 called what was under their cup then player 2 loses a life</li>
			<li>If player 1 lied about the hand under their cup then player 1 loses a life</li>
		</ol>
		<p class = "white">Only the player after the person who has just rolled may call bullshit on their hand. The player next after
			the player that loses a life starts the next round.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "blockwhite">	
		<h6>The Random Roll</h6>
		<p>When you roll a hand lower than the previous player you have 2 options:</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Lie, saying you have a hand greater or equal to the previous hand</li>
			<li>Roll an additional random roll. When this is done you do not get to look or make a call on the dice.
				The next player now has a choice to pull the cup or roll to beat the hand you were originally trying
				to beat. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>A player will usually pull if the hand you were trying to beat is high and roll against a low hand.</p>	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "blockgrey">
		<h6 class = "white">Calling a Big Mia</h6>
		<p class = "white">When a Big Mia is rolled now two lives are at stake. The next player can either:</p>
		<ol class = "white" type="1">
			<li>Call bullshit and the loser of this pull loses 2 lives</li>
			<li>Pass the cup to the next player and the round starts over but the player that passes loses 1 life</li>
		</ol>
		<p class = "white">Say you have one life and the person before you calls a Big Mia, you cannot pass so if you believe them than you can
			try and roll to match their Big Mia. Remember you get 2 rolls your first roll and then random roll.<p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "blockwhite">
		<h6>Dice Belong on the Table</h6>
		<p>If at anytime a player rolls the dice off the table the game is halted and that player must chug their drink. The game
			continues as normal after this is done. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "blockgrey">
		<h6 class = "white">The Finish</h6>
		<p class = "white">The first player to lose all 3 lives must take the reward (shotgun beer or a shot). The losing player then begins the
			next game.<p>
