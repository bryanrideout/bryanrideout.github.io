		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Big Mia is played with a group of people (ideally 4-6 people) who take turns rolling a pair 
			of dice under a cup and either honestly saying or lying what  they rolled. Once a player
			has called a hand they are not allowed to touch the cup. The next player can either 
			believe the called hand and accept the cup trying to roll a larger hand or call bullshit
			on the player lifting the cup to reveal the dice. </p>

		<h3>When do we drink?</h3>
		<h3>Gameplay</h3>
		<p>The game starts with a player rolling the dice and peaking under the cup to see their hand.
			The player calls a hand and the next player clockwise can either accept the call or lift
			the cup. If the next player decides to roll, they must roll a higher or equal hand or 
			lie about rolling a higher or equal hand. This continues until some eventually calls bullshit. </p>
