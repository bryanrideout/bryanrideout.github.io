		<h4 class = "white">Overview</h4>
		<p class = "white">Big Mia is played with a group of people (ideally 4-6 people) who take turns rolling a pair 
			of dice under a cup and either honestly saying or lying what  they rolled. Once a player
			has called a hand they are not allowed to touch the cup. The next player can either 
			believe the called hand and accept the cup trying to roll a larger hand or call bullshit
			on the player lifting the cup to reveal the dice. </p>

		<h4 class = "white">When do we drink?</h4>
		<p class = "white">Now we are getting to the important part. Every player has 3 lives to start, every time a play loses
			a life they drink their drink and the first person to lose all 3 lives has to take the "reward". 
			The reward can be either a shotgunned beer or a shot put up by the group. When a player loses 3 
			lives the game starts over and everyone gets 3 lives. Big Mia is about survival!</p>

	<div class = "blockwhite">
		<h4>Gameplay</h4>
		<h6>Starting</h6>
		<p>The game starts with a player rolling the dice and peaking under the cup to see their hand.
			The player calls a hand and the next player clockwise can either accept the call or lift
			the cup. If the next player decides to roll, they must roll a higher or equal hand or 
			lie about rolling a higher or equal hand. This continues until some eventually calls bullshit. </p>
